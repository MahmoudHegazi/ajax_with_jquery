# ajax_with_jquery

## important notes:

1.  in order to use ajax you have to not add action atribute in the form else it will send u to see the returned repsonce object
2.  it must to add the .js file in static/js if you add it only in /static this not gonna work + it may return after url ? mark
3.  there are 2 ways the old way like this repo which use .done and new way which use sucess and error but this not bad too
4.  you have to preventdefualt in order to let submit button don't change the page or remove the fileds or post it due to builtin reason
